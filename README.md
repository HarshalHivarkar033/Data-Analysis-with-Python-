This project, titled “Data Analysis with Python – Weather Dataset”, focuses on exploring and analyzing weather data using Python. The main objective of this analysis is to answer various questions related to weather patterns, such as determining the average wind speed, identifying how often the weather is exactly clear, and examining different factors like visibility, pressure, relative humidity, snow, and fog. Using the Pandas library, the dataset was cleaned, processed, and analyzed to extract meaningful insights about different weather conditions. The notebook performs statistical analysis and condition-based queries to reveal trends and relationships within the data. Through this analysis, important insights such as the frequency of clear weather, variations in visibility and pressure, and occurrences of fog or snow were identified. This project demonstrates how Python can be effectively used for data manipulation, pattern discovery, and question-driven analysis in real-world datasets.
